# Reinforcement Learning for Taxi Driver Re-positioning Problem in NYC

## Project overview
In this project, we focus on the taxi driver re-positioning problem, i.e. when and where to start the shift and where to cruise to in order to maximize a driverâ€™s income. We aim to find the best spatially and temporally varied policies that maximize drivers' daily earning using reinforcement learning.

Here is a project flowchart:

![Project overview](fig/flowchart.png)

Firstly, we explore and clean NYC Taxi Trip Record dataset. 

Then, we conduct numerous estimations and build a reinforcement learning environment to simulate demand for NYC taxi.

Lastly, we apply SARSA, a widely-used algorithm to historical data and trained best policy.

An additional video can be seen at [this Youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o6KtIySaiU&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=Stelllaaaiii113).

## Key results
1. In the simulated environment, drivers earn \$215 in one shift by following the empirical policy, and earn \$236 by following the derived policy, which means that drivers can earn 9\% more per shift if following the new policy

2. We find an optimal action for each taxi zone at any given time. The following plot show an example of optimal action from 10:00 to 10:15 in NYC. You can also zoom in the map and change time interactively in [this notebook]()

## Dataset
The data that we use is publicly available: [NYC Taxi Trip Record data](https://databank.illinois.edu/datasets/IDB-9610843). The dataset contains Yellow Taxi trip records since January 2009, Green Taxi trip records since August 2013 and FHV trip records since January 2015. It's noteworthy that more recent data is also available, but they lack a key feature: trip fare. Therefore, we decide to use data of previous years.

Due to computational limitation, we choose Yellow Taxi trip records in June 2013 as our training data. Data of one month contain sufficient information we need to proceed. 

## Files
To accelerate the training process, we pre-processed the dataset and stored the processed data, that is, all the computation and estimation processes are done using the files in the [Pre-processing and training files](pre-processing-and-training-files) section. The [Functional files](functional-files) are used for loading the processed data and training the model. If you want to run those files, we suggest you run the files in order as they produced some data file that are used by other files as the inputs.

### Pre-processing and training files
1. Data fetching and cleaning - [convert_to_zone_xx.ipynb](notebooks/convert_to_zone_xx.ipynb)+[EDA_activetime_dist.ipynb](notebooks/EDA_activetime_dist.ipynb). The file contains all the data cleaning process and visualization of some raw features, such as driver income, trip time, trip distance, etc. We stored our the dataset into a database on AWS after converting coordinates to taxi zones. An example of acceessing the database is in [Accessing database.ipynb](notebooks/Accessing database.ipynb). Note that the database may be unavailable in the future. If that is the case, you can still access the dataset by using the link provided above and get the cleaned dataset by making some changes to those notebooks

2. Computation - files starts with "compute_" in "/notebook". Those files process the cleaned dataset to produce the estimation of values that are used for setting up the reinforcement learning environment, and prepare the dataset in SARSA algorithm format for training the model

3. Visualization - files starts with "EDA_" in "/notebook". Those files shows the visualization of processed features such as cruise time and repositioning decisions

4. Result - [OUTPUT_training_report.ipynb](notebook/OUTPUT_training_report.ipynb)+[train.ipynb](./train.ipynb). Those files shows the model convergence and optimal policy, and evaluate drivers' income
